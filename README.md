# React Vite Project 1

A modern, fast, and optimized React application built using Vite and deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Project Overview

This project was developed with React and Vite to take advantage of Vite's blazing-fast build and development environment. It demonstrates clean component architecture, efficient asset management, and seamless deployment on GitHub Pages. The project structure separates static assets in the `public` folder from React source code in the `src` directory, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **React** — Frontend library for building user interfaces  
- **Vite** — Next-generation frontend tooling for fast builds and hot module replacement  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — Modern JavaScript features and syntax  
- **GitHub Pages** — Hosting and deployment platform for static sites
